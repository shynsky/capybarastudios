            Is This You? The Challenges We Solve
          </h2>
          <p>
            Are you spending too much time on repetitive manual tasks? Do you suspect there are inefficiencies in your
            workflows but aren't sure where to start? Many businesses struggle with identifying which processes can be
            effectively automated to save time, reduce costs, and free up their team for more strategic work. You might
            be facing challenges like:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Overwhelming manual data entry or report generation.</li>
            <li>Siloed software systems that don't communicate.</li>
            <li>Repetitive administrative tasks that drain productivity.</li>
            <li>Uncertainty about which automation technologies are right for your specific needs.</li>
            <li>Fear of investing in complex solutions that don't deliver tangible results.</li>

            The Capybara Studios Way: Our Audit Approach
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our Automation Audit is a collaborative and thorough process designed to provide you with a clear,
            actionable roadmap. We don't just look at technology; we look at your business goals and how automation can
            help you achieve them. Our approach involves:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Discovery & Goal Alignment:</strong> We start by understanding your business, your current pain points,
              and your strategic objectives. What does success look like for you?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Workflow Analysis:</strong> We dive deep into your existing processes, mapping out key workflows across
              departments (operations, marketing, sales, admin) to identify bottlenecks and manual effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Technology Stack Review:</strong> We assess your current software and tools to understand what you're
              already using and how new automations can integrate or improve upon it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Opportunity Identification:</strong> Based on our findings, we pinpoint specific, high-impact automation
              opportunities, prioritizing those with the best potential for ROI and quick wins.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Custom Roadmap Delivery:</strong> You receive a detailed report outlining recommended automations,
              estimated benefits (time saved, cost reduction, efficiency gains), technology suggestions, and an implementation
              plan. This roadmap is yours to keep and implement as you see fit, whether with us or another provider.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Our goal is to demystify automation and provide you with a practical, jargon-free plan that empowers you to
            make informed decisions.
